# Raytracing Study Project

Study raytracing from a digital book called  
[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by [Peter Shirley](https://github.com/petershirley)

I will focus first on finishing his books, then see if I can convert the project into a GPU based renderer (probably OpenGL, Vulkan in rare case I got time :D), ideally running real time.

## Building and running:
I have setup VSCode for building and debugging.
TODO: add CMakefile for building this project.
